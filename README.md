# punty level
### _sonic level for glassblowing_

The punty level uses an arduino and small accelerator to check the level of a pipe or punty when blowing glass. The idea is to provide auditory feedback to a gaffer that will tell them when they are tilting the pipe/punty to far. This will hopefully act as a great learning tool for beginners and be a fun toy for more experience glass workers. 

Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/kflana1/punty_level/wiki) for information on how to make your own punty level.
